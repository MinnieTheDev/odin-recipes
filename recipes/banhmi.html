        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This bánh mì (Vietnamese sandwich) is made with chicken and full of pickled vegetables.
            Even though we will be using chicken as the protein in this recipe, you are free to use any protein you like.
            Some alternatives are pork, ham, tofu, and mushroom.
        </p>

            Give this recipe a try. Small warning, though, you may get addicted to bánh mì and make this every other day like I do!
