        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            My go-to lunch fix whenever I'm working from home. This truly is the best avocado toast you'll ever have. If you like an added protein boost, top with scrambled, boiled eggs, or any protein you feel like having (sometimes I do fried soft tofu).
        </p>
        <p>
            Make sure that you make this when you're ready to eat it - as avocado won't stay good for long after its skin and seed are removed.
            If you want to help prolong the life of your avocado mash, add a squeeze or two of fresh lemon juice, and eat within a day!
