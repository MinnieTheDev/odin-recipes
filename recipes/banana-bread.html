        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This banana bread recipe creates the most delicious, moist loaf with loads of banana flavor. 
            It's easy to make and you likely have all the ingredients you'll need for this banana bread recipe on hand.
            It also tastes wonderful toasted.
        </p>
        <p>
            This banana bread is super moist thanks to butter, eggs, and brown sugar (which adds more moisture than white sugar). 
            Plus, mashed bananas have plenty of moisture on their own. 
            Make sure you store the banana bread properly to keep it moist for several days.
            Enjoy!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>2 ⅓ cups mashed overripe bananas</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
            </li>
            <li>Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. 
                Beat brown sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl until smooth. 
                Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture until just combined. 
                Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 minutes. 
                Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
            </li>
        </ol>
