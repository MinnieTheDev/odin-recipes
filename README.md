# odin-recipes

This is the Recipes project as part of The Odin Project Foundations Course.

It is a basic recipe website.

The goal is to practice the HTML knowledge I have acquired from the HTML Foundations lessons.

By completion, skills that will be demonstrated are:
- setting up html boilerplate
- elements and tags
- working with text, headings
- lists
- links and images
- good commit messages
